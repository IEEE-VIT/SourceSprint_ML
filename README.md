This code combines image processing and natural language processing techniques to extract textual information from an image and find similar words or phrases. It loads and displays an image, extracts text content using the CLIP model, and preprocesses the text for analysis. After training a Word2Vec model, it accepts user input and searches for exact or partial matches within the processed text, reporting any findings with a confidence level of 80 or higher.

The expected final result is given in image.png
